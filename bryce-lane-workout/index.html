<p>If i had to plan out a program for the next few months, it would probably look like this: Bryce’s “ the power endurance and flexibility page ” whose tagline is “this is a place for people who don’t just want to do one thing well but are interested in improving all areas of physical performance” nears a parallel. Pick a big compound exercise that can be loaded pretty heavily. This is about a workout to get strong. Personally, i prefer bryce lane�s version. Try to do 50 reps of power cleans or power snatches in 20 min( then up the weight as i make the time )+ 3 sets of 3 reps of front squat or weighted chins ( just a single excercise to finish the session)</p>
