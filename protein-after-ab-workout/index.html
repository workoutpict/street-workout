<p>Whey protein is a milk protein that your body absorbs quickly, making it useful before or after your workout. After a workout your body will need 10 grams of essential amino acids in one sitting to maximize your muscle building and repair, and it needs to be taken with carbs (about 1.5 g x your weight in kg) within 30 minutes after completing your workout. Meaning you are metabolically active because of the increased muscle mass. Meaning you are metabolically active because of the increased muscle mass.</p>

<p>For example, in one 2013 study published in the journal of physiology, men performed resistance exercise and followed up their workout by consuming 80 grams of protein over the next 12 hours. Well if you look at the body builders that are practicing intermittent fasting, it seems like it is working for them…. When you are taking in enough protein after workout, your muscle tissues come back stronger and denser. This will depend on your size and your goals. The thing is that if you eat animal products (that you call protein), you will always be packing extra fat, since all animal products are rich in fat, saturated fat. A 250ml serving of milk and chocolate milk contain approximately 9g of protein.</p>
