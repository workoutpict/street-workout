<p><strong>Nordictrack An Error Occurred Starting Workout</strong>, I have a nordictrack c990 treadmill and a couple weeks in, started getting a connection error pop up which stops the treadmill and requires a power cycle to resolve.

Nordictrack should have installed a working treadmill, and if your treadmill didn’t work, it should have fixed it quickly — not left you for days to.

The short of it is this: Malfunctioning of the control settings or engine &amp; speed sensor errors. It happens every time i finish a workout and browse the courses, and a solid minute of waiting to get through the interface just to load up a workout.</p>
