<p>This would equate to 2 exercises per muscle group for 3 sets, 3 times per week. And if you can only manage to workout 2 times per week, this is literally your only real option. This is necessary because you will not be able to do several exercises for each muscle group when training the whole body. If you can commit to this, throw in some conditioning work once or twice a week, and keep your diet somewhat in line, you won�t lose any ground. Suggest hitting the weight room two days a week to the average trainer and right away you’ll either get strange looks or arguments that its not enough training time to make any real progress towards added size and strength. When using a full body workout routine, you will be limiting the number of exercises per muscle group to one or two at the most.</p>
