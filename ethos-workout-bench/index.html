<p><strong>Ethos Workout Bench</strong>, It’s strong enough (1000 lbs capacity), has enough back pad settings (6), has a wide pad (11.75″), an ideal height (17.5″) and a stable feel. The bench was barely used and in perfect condition, able to handle a lot of weight and does various positions with the adjustable back and bottom. Very interesting stuff, the front spotters even appear to have release pins on the back.</p>
