<p>My answer used to be four: With rack pulls, the barbell is elevated off the floor using the pins or safety bars in a squat rack. Doing heavy squats or deadlifts with a tired lower back could affect your technique. If you do the squat and deadlift workouts with a complete rest day in between, you will have some weeks that you only squat or deadlift once a week. Any structural damage to the spine reduces its capacity to withstand heavy loads during these exercises. You�ll typically be exhausted just after deadlifts and squats alone if you�re pushing yourself to do the other exercises.</p>
