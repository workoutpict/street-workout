<p>Dance yourself FIT! Click pic for link and more, It is created by shaun t. Ha well not in this cize review! I would also recommend dance shoes on a hard surface or dance socks for the carpet. Being 6�3″ i have always felt awkward on the dance floor. It is a great cardio workout.</p>

<p>Cize Review Dance &amp; Burn Calories Have Fun!, I work up a sweat every.single.time i do. Being 6�3″ i have always felt awkward on the dance floor. For better or for worse, the cize workout cannot bulk you even a bit. It is not created for everybody, and caters only to a handful of fitness goals. It would also be a good choice for someone just getting back.</p>
