<p><strong>Tut Back Workout</strong>, It rides on the theory that the more stress, or tension, that’s placed on the muscle, the more breakdown will occur, leading to gains.

<p>If you have to lower the weight by more than five pounds, speed up the tempo so it’s not quite so slow and you can successfully complete the exercise. Here is the first exercise we are going to incorporate tut into our back and bicep workout. Start with the top of the dumbbell press. The first is to set a timer—say, for 40 seconds—and continue to perform an exercise for that amount of time without stopping. I�m using a pair of 65 lb dumbbells for this.next time, i�ll go a bit heavier as i was hitting around 90 seconds of tut per set, which is on the high end for hypertrophy. A more effective way, and the one this program will focus on, is to use a tempo prescription for each rep.</p>
