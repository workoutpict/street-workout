<center>Insanity workout review From slideshare.net</center>
<p>I decided to give their streaming workout service, beachbody on demand, a try to find out for myself. Insanity is a dangerous high impact workout, yes the risk of injury is high, also you will not get results without good nutrition, supplements, and rest. “so, matt says you’re on the neanderthal diet’?”. I think it depends on what the individual person is looking for or likes to do.</p>

<p>Insanity Workout Results &amp; Review YouTube, Insanity is highly commercialized and only focuses on muscle development. There was no interval training. My biggest complaint with insanity was they don�t have a very good scaling mechanism. It’s for people who are already pretty fit and have zero health complaints.
