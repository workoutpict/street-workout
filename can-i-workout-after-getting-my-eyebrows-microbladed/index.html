<p>I had my eyebrows microbladed 4 weeks ago and i kept aquafor (vaseline works too) i did coconut oil as well and left the cream or oil on it basically all day for nearly two weeks Give yourself extra time for the appointment to ensure the best results. It would be best if you avoided any activities that will induce sweating while your brows are healing. Kristin did warn me that i was going to look like angry birds for the first two weeks and she wasn’t joking. While it’s ok, and highly recommend to wash the eyebrows with soap and water 4 hours after the microblading procedure, we can’t ask our clients enough not to do these things at least 2 to 7 days right after the have their eyebrows microbladed when it comes to getting the eyebrows wet (they are considered the “bad wet”) at least 2 days. Good for everyday but not sure about the water sports.</p>
