<p><strong>5 Day Workout Split Each Muscle Twice A Week</strong>, With a 5 day split, you work the entire muscle group and then it basically has an entire week to recover before the next session. For added variety, you could use different set and rep schemes on different training days. The 5 day split workout is extremely manageable, you hit the gym 5 days a week and focus on an individual muscle group each workout.</p>

<p>Using a bro split, you train 5 times a week (suboptimal in terms of efficiency) while training each muscle group only once a week (suboptimal in terms of effectiveness). I felt like i was devoting too much time on legs, while trying to cram my entire upper body into one workout twice a week. No need to schedule pushing and pulling exercises or anything else that often confuses and overwhelms newcomers. Depending on the frequency, your session can be shorter.</p>

<p>Hence, targetting every muscle group once a week is better. Strictly speaking, you’re not training each muscle group twice a week. For added variety, you could use different set and rep schemes on different training days. Also, the 5 day split offers two rest days. Basically been following my own routine, typical 5 day split (chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms) but i feel i need to mix it up a bit. So, you can divide the same volume across more sessions per week instead of squeezing in a lot of volume.</p>
