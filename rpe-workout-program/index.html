<p>Very light to light effort. You could have done 2 more reps. Essentially, rpe is a rating of how close to failure you get after each set. Rpe is how hard something feels to you at the time. Rpe—or the rate of perceived exertion—is a scale used to identify the intensity of your exercise based on how hard you feel (or perceive) your effort to be. It uses 4 training days per week and divides the 12 week program into four different training blocks ending with a taper.</p>

<p>RPE scale3 Missi Balison Fitness, Rpe load is the rate of perceived exertion multiplied by the duration (in minutes) it took to complete the training load. For example, if rate of perceived exertion is 6 and the workout took 50 minutes to complete, the rpe load would be 300. Rpe is more easily understood visually with a chart (taken from our 6 day workout routine.</p>
