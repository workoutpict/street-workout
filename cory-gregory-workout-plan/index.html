<p>10 body weight exercises of 100 reps each. Foundation, pyramid, pump, and detail, plus a bonus growth boost phase. A former underground coal miner, gregory worked diligently to save money to realize his dream of opening his own gym by the age of 20.

That s why you spend hour after hour, week after week, month after month, and year after year grinding away in the weight room. Instead of ab rollers we did a combo of hanging leg raises and russian twists.</p>
