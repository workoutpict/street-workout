<p>To compare an exercise bike magnetic vs flywheel, you first need to know how they are alike and different both magnetic and flywheel bikes have a flywheel of sorts. The rider begins pedalling and the flywheel starts spinning. During a flywheel workout, you experience that the energy you put into the concentric phase (pull) equals the energy that you need to put into the eccentric phase (deceleration), to. It connects to the pedals via a chain or a belt and stores the rotational energy generated during a workout. The momentum builds and the flywheel supplies a smooth and steady cycling action. Therefore, if you are looking for a more challenging.</p>
