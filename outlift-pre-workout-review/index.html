<p>The servings are huge which will obviously end up costing a little extra. I liked the effects from the citrulline, normally in many pre workout supplements citrulline is far too under dosed to offer any benefit to your workout. Blend “real science” and “extreme energy”. The most glaring one, in our opinion, is its formulation. You won’t find any shady transparency blends in nutrex outlift amped. Nutrex says it created this newer version to “ [bridge] the gap for those wanting clinically dosed ingredients…and extreme levels of stimulant energy”.</p>
