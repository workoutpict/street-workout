<p>The insanity workouts focus primarily on cardio and elevated heart rates and not much attention is given to strength. This workout is scheduled once a week, it’s about 33 minutes long, and has no cardio! Meaning, if you have any sort of heart condition or risks, you should most certainly check in with your doctor first. To say you can go 60 solid days without sustaining injury or throwing in the towel is a rare accomplishment and i would caution anyone over 40 to know your limits and take a little extra rest where needed. What makes insanity timeless has less to do with production values and more with the sheer intensity of the whole program. Shaun t himself advises people to consult with their doctors before attempting it, and states that the intense level of cardio, plyometrics and calisthenics will challenge even incredibly fit and athletic individuals.</p>
