<p>It is a compound with antioxidant benefits and for the role it plays in various body’s vital functions, including the production of energy. Endurance athletes pump higher amounts of oxygen through their respiratory systems during exercise compared to the resting condition. It is also a natural antioxidant with free radical scavenging abilities as well as the ability to regenerate oxidized antioxidants. Ala’s major role is to support the function of enzymes in the mitochondria—the structures which generate cellular energy. I still recommend taking a simple sugary carb after your workout, but ala can increase creatine uptake while you take a lower amount of sugar. Spiking insulin before a high carb meal is not always ideal.</p>
