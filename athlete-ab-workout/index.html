<p>When the track athlete challenges various muscles throughout the body, the muscles increase in size (varies) and are more noticeable. Start the movement by contracting your abs and slowly twisting from your torso to your right and tap the medicine ball on the floor beside you. With each of these exercises, be sure to focus on bracing the abs by breathing in and expanding the stomach while flexing and squeezing the abdominal muscles. On your heaviest sets, if you need a belt, by all means strap one on.</p>
